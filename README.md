Disclaimer: I'm not continuing this project. It was my first python project and I quickly abandoned it in favour of a web-based solution.

This is a simple tag-based local image organizer that allows you to: 
  - COMPLETE collect image files on your computer under pools
  - COMPLETE tag these files
  - COMPLETE save a record of all files and their data
  - search according to these tags and other metadata
  - maintain multiple image files open in multiple tabs
  - rip images from popular sites and image boards
  - edit and crop images with very basic functionality
  
This is currently being worked on for fun and as a way to learn Python.
Being my first project, some/most code is unpythonic and may have bad practices.
This is also my first GUI project, so the way in which the Model-View-Presenter
design pattern is implemented is not optimal, but it works.

Uses:
  - PyQt5
